Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a fully-managed real-time messaging service that allows you to send and receive messages between independent applications. Pub/Sub is an asynchronous global messaging service. By decoupling senders and receivers, it allows for secure and highly available communication between independently written applications. Pub/Sub delivers low-latency, durable messaging.

In Pub/Sub, publisher applications and subscriber applications connect with one another through the use of a shared string called a topic. A publisher application creates and sends messages to a topic. Subscriber applications create a subscription to a topic to receive messages from it.

Pub Sub allows for both push and pull delivery. In the pull model, your clients are subscribers, and will be periodically calling for messages, and Pub Sub will just be delivering the messages since the last call. In the pull model, you're going to have to acknowledge the message as a separate step. In the pull model, the messages are stored for up to seven days.  In the push model, it actually uses an HTTP endpoint. You register a web hook as your subscription, and Pub Sub infrastructure itself will call you with the latest messages. In the case of push, you just respond with status 200OK for the HTTP call, and that tells Pub Sub the message delivery was successful. It will actually use the rate of your success responses to self-limit so that it doesn't overload your worker. The way the acknowledgments work is to ensure every message gets delivered at least once. What happens is when you acknowledge a message, you acknowledge on a per subscription basis. There is a replay mechanism as well that you can rewind and go back in time and have it replay messages. But in any case, you will always be able to go back seven days.

If topic message retention is enabled, storage costs for the messages retained by the topic are to be built to the topic's project. Subscribers can work individually or as a group.
When the Pub/Sub service redelivers the message with an ordering key, the Pub/Sub service also redelivers every subsequent message with the same ordering key, including acknowledged messages. If both message ordering and a dead letter topic are enabled on a subscription, the ordering may not be true, as Pub/Sub forwards messages to dead letter topics on a best effort basis. To receive the messages in order, set the message ordering property on the subscription you receive messages from.
Dataflow will de-duplicate messages based on the message ID, because in Pub/Sub, if a message is delivered twice, it will have the same ID in both cases. Element Source adds a default date timestamp, or DTS, which is the time of entry to the system rather than the time the sensor data was captured. A PTransform extracts the date timestamp from the data portion of the element and modifies the DTS metadata so the time of data capture can be used in window processing.
