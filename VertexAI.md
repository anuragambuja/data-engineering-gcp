# Vertex AI

- It's a fully managed service for custom machine learning models, both training and serving predictions.
- VertexAI (your model, your data), AutoML ( our model, your data)
- It can scale from the experimentation stage all the way to production.
- A simple ML pipeline might do the following.
  - Load a dataset from a comma-separated value file.
  - Analyze the dataset to identify and remove outliers.
  - Split the cleaned dataset into a training and evaluation dataset.
  - Train a model on the training dataset.
  - Evaluate the model against the evaluation dataset.
 
- Kubeflow Pipelines is a Kubernetes-native, open source product, that has grown into the industry standard for running ML pipelines over the years.
