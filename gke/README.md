- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google infrastructure. The Kubernetes Engine environment consists of multiple machines (specifically Compute Engine instances) grouped to form a container cluster.
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters are powered by the Kubernetes open source cluster management system. Kubernetes provides the mechanisms through which you interact with your container cluster. When you run a GKE cluster, you also gain the benefit of advanced cluster management features that Google Cloud provides. These include:
  -	Load balancing for Compute Engine instances
  -	Node pools to designate subsets of nodes within a cluster for additional flexibility
  -	Automatic scaling of your cluster's node instance count
  -	Automatic upgrades for your cluster's node software
  -	Node auto-repair to maintain node health and availability
  -	Logging and Monitoring with Cloud Monitoring for visibility into your cluster
