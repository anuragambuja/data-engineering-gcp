- Feature: A feature refers to a factor that contributes to the prediction. It’s like an independent variable in statistics or a column in a table. It describes characterstics of an entity, act as an input variable. eg. height, length of an entity
- Labels: An attribute that is predicted or categorized. eg, selling price, income, Fraud/Non Fraud
- Feature Engineering: Identifying useful features
- Vertex AI provides a service called Vertex AI Feature Store, which is a centralized repository to manage, serve, and share features. Benefits of Vertex AI Feature Store:
  - They are managed and served from a central repository, maintaining consistency across your organization.
  - features are reusable.
  - features are scalable.
 
- confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a specific performance measurement for machine learning classification problems

> ## Explainable AI
- Explainable AI is a set of tools and frameworks to help understand and interpret predictions made by machine learning models.
 
> ## Responsible AI

Seven principles for responsible AI:
1. AI should be socially beneficial.
2. AI should avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.
3. AI should be built and tested for safety. -  seeks to promote the safety—both bodily integrity and overall health of people and communities, as well as the security of places, systems, properties, and infrastructures from attack or disruption.
4. AI should be accountable to people. -  aims to respect people’s rights and independence. The principle aims to promote informed user consent, and it seeks to ensure that there is a path to report and redress misuse, unjust use, or malfunction.
5. AI should incorporate privacy design principles. - the aim is to protect the privacy and safety of both individuals and groups. It is also the goal of the principle to ensure that users have clear expectations of how data will be used, and that they feel informed and have the ability to give consent to that use.
6. AI should uphold high standards of scientific excellence. - seeks to advance the state of knowledge in AI. This means to follow scientifically rigorous approaches and ensure that feature claims are scientifically credible.
7. AI should be made available for uses that accord with these principles. - The principle aims for the widest availability and impact of our beneficial AI technologies, while discouraging harmful or abusive AI applications.
