# TensorFlow
- TensorFlow is an open-source, high-performance library for numerical computation thats uses directed graphs
- A tensor is an N-dimensional array od data. The simplest piece od data is called scalar. Scalar -> Vector -> Matrix ->  3D tensor -> 4D tensor

- TensorFlow graphs are portable between different devices. You can build a DAG in Python, store it in a saved model, restore it in C++ program for low latency predictions, you can use this same Python code and execute it both on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. This provides language and hardware portability. TensorFlow Lite provides on-device inference of ML models on mobile devices and is available for a variety of hardware.

- tf.constant will produce tensors with constant values whereas tf.variable produces tensors with variable values or ones that can be modified.
