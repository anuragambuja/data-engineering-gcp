1. A human resources department deploys a generative AI (gen AI) model to screen job applications and provide a shortlist of candidates to recruiters. Recruiters notice that some seemingly qualified candidates are consistently being overlooked, but the AI provides no explanation for its rankings or exclusions. The company needs to address this lack of transparency. What should they do?
  A. Collect a larger and more diverse dataset for the gen AI model.
  B. Fine-tune the gen AI model.
  C. Implement explainable gen AI policies.
  D. Develop fairness assessments for the gen AI model.

Ans: C.

A is incorrect because, while a larger and more diverse dataset could potentially improve the model's accuracy and reduce bias, it does not inherently make the model's screening process transparent. Recruiters would still lack insight into why certain candidates are being shortlisted over others. While data quality is essential for ethical AI, it doesn't automatically provide explainability.
B is incorrect because fine-tuning aims to optimize the model's performance on the screening task, but it doesn't necessarily reveal how the model is making its choices. Even if the shortlist improves after fine-tuning, the lack of transparency regarding the selection criteria remains. Fine-tuning focuses on improving task-specific performance, not on making the model's reasoning understandable.
C is correct because it directly tackles the issue of unclear decision-making. Implementing explainable gen AI techniques would allow the HR department and recruiters to understand the factors that the AI model is using to rank and exclude candidates. This aligns with the principle that transparency is paramount for ethical applications and that users need to understand how AI systems make decisions. Explainable AI makes the decision-making processes of AI models transparent and understandable, which is crucial for building trust and identifying potential issues.
D is incorrect because, while developing fairness assessments is important for ensuring the AI model is not discriminatory in its candidate selection, it does not directly address the need to understand why the model is making specific decisions. Assessing for fairness helps identify potential biases, but it doesn't explain the reasoning behind individual candidate rankings or exclusions.
