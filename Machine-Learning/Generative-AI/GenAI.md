> ## primary ways to use generative AI
- Create: Using generative AI to create new content, such as: 
  - Writing articles, emails, and social media posts.
    - Generate text responses to customer service inquiries using Conversational AI.
    - Draft emails to clients using Gemini in Gmail.
  - Creating images, videos, and audio
    - Create a custom image for a presentation using Gemini in Google Slides.
    - Generate multiple design concepts for brainstorming marketing materials such as website pages using Imagen.
    - Create video tutorials to guide customers through troubleshooting steps using Google Vids.
  - Generating code in various programming languages
    - Generate unit tests and other test cases for code, reducing the manual effort required for testing while still ensuring the code works as expected.
    - Generate code as a starting point for larger software development projects using Gemini Code Assist.
- Summarize: Condense large amounts of information into concise summaries, such as:
  - Summarizing long documents or articles
    - Summarize a lengthy financial report without having to read the entire document using NotebookLM Enterprise.
    - Summarize customer reviews to understand product feedback and sentiment using Gemini in Looker.
  - Extracting key takeaways from meetings or presentations
    - Project managers can automatically generate meeting notes that highlight key decisions and action items using Gemini in Google Meet.
    - Sales teams can use summaries to quickly recap client calls and identify next steps.
  - Creating concise reports from complex data
    - Transform complex data into easily understandable visuals like graphs using Gemini in BigQuery.
- Discover: Help your customers and employees find what they need at the right time, such as:
  - Uncovering hidden patterns and insights in data
    - Analyze purchase history and website traffic to predict future demand and optimize inventory using forecasting models on Vertex AI.
    - Identify viewing patterns of streaming viewers to recommend personalized content to subscribers, increasing engagement and reducing churn using Vertex AI Search.
    - Analyze vast datasets of molecular structures to identify potential drug candidates with higher success rates by fine-tuning models on Vertex AI.
  - Searching for resources or documents 
    - Search for a file or ask questions about its contents using Gemini in Google Drive.
    - Unlock enterprise expertise for employees with agents that bring together Gemini’s advanced reasoning, Google-quality search, and enterprise data, regardless of where it’s hosted using Google Agentspace.
  - Monitoring real-time events
    - Use anomaly detection to identify fraudulent transactions and prevent financial losses.
- Automate: Automate tasks that previously required human intervention, such as:
  - Automated format conversation
    - Convert content to accessible formats in real time by using Google Cloud's APIs, like Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text, Translation, and more.
  - Automated documentation
    - Analyze code and automatically generate clear and concise documentation, saving developers time and ensuring consistency using Codey. 
    - Automate contract review and information extraction with Document AI.
  - Automated notifications and alarms
    - Automate customer feedback analysis and ticket creation.
  
> ## Foundation model
- Foundation models are large-scale, general-purpose models trained on a massive amount of data. Examples: Gemini, Imagen, Chirp
- Foundation models, like other AI models, take in inputs, which are called prompts, to produce outputs.
- LLMs focus specifically on language-based tasks within the broader capabilities of foundation models.
- Key features of foundation models
  - Trained on diverse data: Foundation models are trained on a wide variety of data, allowing them to learn general patterns and relationships that can be applied to different tasks.
  - Flexible: With foundation models, one AI model can support a wide range of use cases.
  - Adaptable: Foundation models can be specialized for particular domains or use cases through additional, targeted training.
