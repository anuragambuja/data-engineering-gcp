# Cloud Run

- Cloud Run functions allow you to execute code in response to various Google Cloud events. These events can originate from sources like HTTP requests, Pub/Sub messages, Cloud Storage changes, Firestore updates, or custom events through Eventarc.
- When triggered, a Cloud Run function provides a serverless execution environment where your code runs, supporting multiple programming languages for flexibility.
