- Bare Metal Solution is a managed solution that provides purpose-built bare-metal servers in regional extensions that are connected to Google Cloud by a managed, high-performance connection with a low-latency network fabric.
- With Bare Metal Solution, Google Cloud provides and manages the core infrastructure, the network, the physical and network security, and hardware monitoring capabilities in an environment from which you can access all of the Google Cloud services. The core infrastructure includes secure, controlled-environment facilities, and power. The network, which is managed by Google Cloud, includes a low-latency Partner Interconnect connection into the customer Bare Metal Solution environment. You are responsible for the software, applications, and data that you use and store in the Bare Metal Solution environment. You are responsible for the licensing of all of your software. Bare Metal Solution uses a bring-your-own-license (BYOL) model.

- Use Bare Metal Solution to run:
  - Third-party virtualization software.
  - Applications that require direct, low-level access to the server.
