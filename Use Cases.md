# Eventarc overview

- Eventarc offers a standardized solution to manage the flow of state changes, called events, between decoupled microservices.
- When triggered, Eventarc routes these events to various destinations while managing delivery, security, authorization, observability, and error-handling for you.
- An event is a data record expressing an occurrence and its context. For example, an event might be a change to data in a database, a file added to a storage system, or a scheduled job.
