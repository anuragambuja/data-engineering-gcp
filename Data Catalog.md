Data Catalog is a fully managed, scalable metadata management service within Dataplex that you can use to tag data assets and search for assets to which you have access. Tags allow you to attach custom metadata fields to specific data assets for easy identification and retrieval (such as tagging certain assets as containing protected or sensitive data); you can also create reusable tag templates to rapidly assign the same tags to different data assets.
