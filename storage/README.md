â€¢	cloud storage 
Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.
standard storage is considered best for frequently accessed or hot data it's also great for data that is stored for only brief periods of time
nearline storage this is best for storing infrequently accessed data like reading or modifying data once per month or less on average examples include data backups long tail multimedia content or data archiving.
cold line storage this is also a low cost option for storing infrequently accessed data however as compared to nearline storage cold line storage is meant for reading or modifying data at most once every 90 days
archive storage this is the lowest cost option used ideally for data archiving online backup and disaster recovery it's the best choice for data that you plan to access less than once a year because it has higher costs for data access and operations and a 365-day minimum storage duration
Cloud Storage supports multithreaded, resumable loads.
IAM is standard across the Google Cloud. It is set at the bucket level and applies uniform access rules to all objects within a bucket. Access control lists can be applied at the bucket level or on individual objects, so it provides more fine-grained access control. IAM provides project roles and bucket roles, including bucket reader, bucket writer and bucket owner. The ability to create or change access control lists is an IAM bucket role and the ability to create and delete buckets and to set IAM policy is a project level role. When you create a bucket, you are offered the option of disabling access lists and only using IAM. You can disable access lists even if they were in-force previously. As an example, you might give some bob@example.com reader access to a bucket through IAM, and also give them write access to a specific file in that bucket through access control lists.
